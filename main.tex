\chapter{Abstract}

The Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MCRT) method can simulate the transport of light through turbid media.
MCRT allows the modelling of multiple anisotropic scattering events, as well as a range of microphysics such as polarisation and fluorescence.
This thesis concerns the development of several MCRT algorithms to solve various biophotonic and medically-related problems including modelling of tissue ablation and autofluorescent signals.
An extension of the MCRT method through a theoretical quasi-wave/particle model is also demonstrated, allowing beam shapes with arbitrary phase profiles to be propagated.

Tissue ablation can be used to treat acne scarring, Rhinophyma, and it can also be used to help enhance topical drug delivery.
Currently the depth of ablation is not easily elucidated from a given laser or laser power setting.
Therefore, a numerical tissue ablation model is developed using a combination of MCRT, a heat diffusion model, and a numerical tissue damage model to assess ablation crater depth and thermal damage to the surrounding tissue.

Autofluorescence is the natural fluorescence of biological structures in tissue.
Autofluorescence can be used as a biomarker of several diseases including: cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimers, and diabetes.
However, the origin of the autofluorescence signal is not completely clear.
The effect of tissue optics on the signal, which fluorophores contribute to the signal and by how much, and how different locations on the body can affect the signal are not well understood.
This thesis presents a study of the effect of tissue optics on the autofluorescent signal.
As part of this study, AmoebaMCRT was created to determine the relative concentrations of fluorophores for a given autofluorescent signal.

Finally, we developed an extension to the MCRT method which allows the simulation of quasi-wave/particles.
This method relies on the Huygens-Fresnel principle and the tracking of the phase of each individual photon packet.
The extension, $\varphi$MC, allows the modelling of complex beams that require the wave properties of light such as arbitrary order Bessel beams and Gaussian beams.
We then use $\varphi$MC to predict which beam, Bessel or Gaussian, performs ``better'' in a highly turbid medium.


\chapter{Acknowledgements}
First of all, thank you to my supervisors Dr.~Kenny Wood and Prof.~Tom Brown for allowing me the opportunity to undertake this PhD, and for all their support and encouragement over the course of my thesis.
If it weren't for you both keeping me on the straight and narrow I'm sure I would still be coding instead of writing.
Also, I swear my code is now bug free...
\medskip


Thank you to Isla for answering all my stupid questions over the past three years, and for being a good source of moral support, and good company at conferences.
Also thanks for co-founding, and mostly running, Code \& Cake. I thoroughly enjoyed it, both the baking and the talks.
Finally, thanks for reading over this thesis.
\medskip

Thank you to Sascha, Salvo, Blanca, Faisal, Danni, and Mike for allowing me to collaborate with you, and for your kindness with the time you gave me.
\medskip

Thank you to everyone at Ninewells for making me feel welcome every time I took up space in your research office.
In particular thanks to Luke, Paul, and Ewan for letting me collaborate with you, and for your good company at the conferences we attended together.
\medskip

Thank you to the whole McConnell family; Evelyn, Stevie, and Heather, for welcoming me to stay at your home whilst Kathleen and I were between homes, and for finding accommodation for us both.
I would also like to thank you for everything that you have done for me over these past four years, it has made it so much easier to complete this thesis.
Thank you also to the thesis fairy for the much needed Haribo as I was writing up.
\medskip

A huge thank you to my Mum, Rachel, Eilidh, Allan, Caroline, and Archie, for all the support you have given to me over my last nine years at St Andrews.
All your frequent messages on the family chat have been a source of entertainment and much needed distraction.
I can't begin to list everything you have done for me, but I really appreciate knowing that you are always there for me.
\medskip

Finally, last but certainly not least, to Kathleen.
This thesis would never have been completed if it wasn't for your constant love and support.
Thank you for understanding when I got stressed or chose to work weekends and nights on my PhD, and even on the occasions where I never noticed the time and forgot to meet you.
\noindent Consider reading this as the favour repaid for when I read your \textbf{two} dissertations!
