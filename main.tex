The Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MCRT) method can simulate the transport of light through turbid media.
MCRT allows the simulation of multiple anisotropic scattering events, as well as a range of microphysics such as polarisation, and fluorescence.
This thesis concerns the development of several MCRT algorithms to solve various biophotonic and medical problems.
Modelling of tissue ablation, autofluorescent signals, and a theoretical quasi-wave/particle MCRT model were developed as part of this thesis.

Tissue ablation can be used to treat acne scarring and Rhinophyma, it can also be used to help enhance topical drug delivery.
Currently depth of ablation is not easily elucidated from a given laser or laser power setting.
Therefore, a numerical tissue ablation model is developed using MCRT, a heat diffusion model, and a numerical tissue damage model to assess ablation crater depth and thermal damage to the surrounding tissue.

Autofluorescence is the natural fluorescence of biological structures in tissue.
Autofluorescence can be used as a biomarker of several diseases including: cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimers and diabetes.
However, the origin of the signal is not completely clear.
The effect of tissue optics on the signal, which fluorophores contribute to the signal and by how much, and how different locations on the body can effect the signal are all not well understood.
This thesis presents a study of the effect of tissue optics on the autofluorescent signal.
As part of this study AmoebaMCRT was created to determine the relative concentrations of fluorophores for a given autofluorescent signal.

Finally, we developed an extension to the MCRT method that allows the simulation of quasi-wave/particles.
This method relies on the Huygens-Fresnel principle and the tracking of the phase of each individual photon packet.
The extension, $\varphi$MC, allows the modelling of complex beams that require the wave properties of light such as arbitrary order Bessel beams, and Gaussian beams.
We then use $\varphi$MC to predict which beam, Bessel or Gaussian, preforms ``better'' in a highly turbid medium.


% Chapter 3 introduces a numerical model of tissue ablation.
% This models uses MCRT to calculate the energy deposited by a laser, a numerical heat simulation to diffuse the heat deposited by the laser, and finally a numerical tissue damage model to calculate the damage to the tissue due to the laser.
% Laser tissue ablation is used for a variety of medical and cosmetic treatments.
% It can be used to help topical drug diffusion, treat acne and rhinophyma, and can make the skin look younger.
% This model was created to predict ablation crater depth, and to help and optimise ablation treatments which can lead to improved patient outcomes.

% The work in chapter 4 pertains to the modification of the ``traditional'' ballistic light MCRT algorithm, such that it can now model wave like behaviour of light.
% This work was undertaken so that a comparison of Bessel beams and Gaussian beams propagation in turbid media can be carried out.

% Finally, the work contained in chapter 5 focuses on the modelling of the autofluorescence response of human skin.
% The autofluorescent response of tissue has been noted as a biomarker for various disease, including cardiovascular disease.
% This chapter presents a discussion on the effect of tissue optics on the natural fluorescence of cells, including how Fitzpatrick skin type, area of the body, and blood volume effect the response of the various fluorophores responsible for the autofluorescent response.

% First of all, thank you to Tom, and Kenny for first allowing me the opportunity to undertake this PhD and for all their support and encouragement over the course of my thesis.
% If it weren't for you both keeping me on the straight and narrow I'm sure I would still be coding instead of writing.
% I also swear my code is now bug free...
% \medskip

% Thank you to Ian for getting me access to Wardlaw andKennedy computer clusters.
% Most of this work wouldn't be possible without it.
% \medskip

% Thank you to Isla for answering all my stupid questions over the past three years, and for being a good source of moral support.
% Thank you also for allowing me to be a part of code and cake, which I thoroughly enjoyed, both the baking and the talks.
% \medskip

% Thank you to all at Ninewells for making me feel welcome every time I took up space in your research office.
% Especially thank you to Luke, Paul, and Ewan for letting me collaborate with you, and 
% for your good company at the conferences we attended together.
