\chapter{Modelling fluorescent images}

\section{Problem}

Code `works'. Need to validate code against toy model to confirm (may need to do this on kennedy cluster). Then scale up to supercomputer level and run tests so we can get request time on Archer(Edinburgh). 

Paper has a couple of sections complete, just theory so far. Most of paper to be written. Contact with Madrid again once code is on Archer??

\section{Validation}
\section{Practical application}
