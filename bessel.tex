\chapter{3D phase tracking Monte Carlo algorithm}

\section{Problem}

Current problem is that the simulated bessel beam is not `correct'. Central spot size is smaller than it should be and it is also `brighter'.
Ring spacing is correct, and depending upon how I count amplitudes, the power in each ring is either correct or not.

Paper is mostly written. `Just' need to finish research and write up results before I can submit.
