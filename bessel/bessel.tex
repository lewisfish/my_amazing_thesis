\section{Introduction}\label{sec:besintro}

Intro = mention complex beams and their uses then move onto gaussian and bessel beams

Bessel beams have been the subject of intense research since their discovery in 1987~\cite{durnin1987diffraction,durnin1987exact}. Durnin noticed that the blah blah.
Bessel beams have since been used for blah blah
They are really good and like are better than Gaussian beams allegedly.

This chapter examines how Bessel beams compare to other beam in a scattering medium. 
We investigate if the Bessel beams self-healing property has any effect in a turbid medium.
We examine Bessel beams and the other beams by creating a novel~\gls{mcrt} algorithm that allows the tracking of a photon as it propagates through a medium. 
The main focus of this chapter, is validation of our new novel technique, followed by using the new algorithm ($\varphi MC$) to compare Gaussian and Bessel beams, to see which one preforms better in a turbid medium. 
This chapter also extends out novel algorithm to other complex, diffraction less beams


motivation = better imaging of chick embryos etc


\section{Theory}\label{sec:bestheory}

The \gls{mcrt} algorithm as described in~\cref{sec:mcrt}, must be adjusted so that wave phenomena such as interference and diffraction can be modelled. 
Modelling these wave behaviours allows us to model complex beams, where these phenomena are required to form the beam, e.g Bessel beams. 
As \gls{mcrt} is a ballistic simulation of photon packets, meaning that the \gls{mcrt} simulation presented thus far in this thesis only modelled the ballistic behaviour of photons. 
However for the work presented in this chapter, wave like behaviour is crucial to modelling the various experiments and phenomena.

In order to convert a ballistic simulation of photon packets into a ballistic/wave-like simulation, the complex phase of each photon packet is tracked.
This is achieved, by simply tracking the complex phase of the photon as it propagates through a medium.
~\Cref{eqn:phase} shows how the phase is calculated.

\begin{equation}
    \varphi = cos\left(\frac{2 \pi l}{\lambda}\right) + i\ sin\left(\frac{2 \pi l}{\lambda}\right)
    \label{eqn:phase}
\end{equation}

Where $\varphi~[-]$ is the phase of a photon packet, $l\ [m]$ is the distance the photons has travelled, and $\lambda~[m]$ is the wavelength of the photon.
Now we can calculate the phase of a photon at a position $P_o$, if we know the distance it has travelled, and its original phase,~\cref{fig:phase-diag}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{phase-diag.pdf}
    \caption{Example of phase calculation when a photon has travelled a distance l. Figure also show an example of interference between two photons.}
    \label{fig:phase-diag}
\end{figure}

To be able model the wave-like behaviour of photons, we let the photons packets interfere with one another in a volume or area element. 
We do not model the interference at a point in space where photons packets cross one another as due to the ballistic nature of the \gls{mcrt} simulation, this does not occur with enough frequency in order to give a good signal to noise ratio. 
Thus, interference takes place in a volume, $dV$, or area element, $dA$, instead.
To calculate the interference from the phase, the phase is summed in each volume or area element and the absolute value taken, and then squared.~\Cref{eqn:intense} shows the equation for interference for a volume element $dV$. A similar relation for calculating the interference on an area element $dA$ also exists.

\begin{equation}
I(\xi)=\left| \sum\limits_{\xi}cos\left(\frac{2\pi l}{\lambda}\right) + i \sum\limits_{\xi}sin\left(\frac{2\pi l}{\lambda}\right)\right|^2,\ \ \ \xi=(x,y,z)
\label{eqn:intense}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where:

\indent $l$ is the total distance travelled by a photon [$m$];

\indent $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon [$m$];

\indent $I$ is the intensity at the $\xi^{th}$ cell [$W m^{-2}$];

\indent and $\xi$ is the $x^{th}$, $y^{th}$, $z^{th}$ cell, volume $dV$.

\medskip

As the \gls{mcrt} simulation is now a quasi ballistic/wave simulation of photon behaviour, comparisons between the simulations and, theoretical and experimental data to prove this model is accurate. However before validation of the model takes place, one further principle needs to be introduced that is required for our model to work.

\subsection{Huygens-Fresnel Principle}

The Huygens-Fresnel principle is a method that is used to help model the propagation of waves in the far-field limit and the near-field limit. 

The Huygens principle states: 

\medskip

``Every point point on a wavefront acts as a source of spherical wavelets, and that the sum of all the wavelets forms the wavefront.''***ref***

\medskip

The principle is illustrated in~\cref{fig:huygensillis}. Christiaan Huygens postulated this principle in 1678.
The principle allowed Huygens to derive laws of refraction and reflection using this principle, but it failed to describe diffraction effects.
This led to Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1818, combining the Huygens principle with his own theory of interference.
This principle, the Huygens-Fresnel principle, gave an accurate description of the propagation of light and diffraction effects.
This was achieved by allowing the secondary wavelets to self interfere with one another, giving rise to an accurate description of the physical phenomena.
Later, Gustav Kirchhoff gave a rigours mathematical description of the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which is the basis of diffraction theory. *refs for this section*

    \label{fig:huygensillis}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Validation of Phase Tracking Algorithm}

The first test of our phase tracking algorithm, is to compare our simulation to a double slit experiment.
The double slit experiment, is a simple experiment where monochromatic plane wave of light is incidence on two slits, and the interference pattern is observed on a screen a distance $d$ away from the slits.

In this experiment blah bla ***

\begin{equation}
    I(\theta) \propto cos^2\left(\frac{\pi d\ sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)sinc^2\left(\frac{\pi b\ sin\theta}{\lambda}\right)
\end{equation}
Where the $sinc$ function is defined as $\tfrac{sin(x)}{x}$, for $x\ \neq 0$, b is the slit width, d is the slit separation and $\theta$ is the angular spacing of the fringes.

\section{Bessel Beams}


\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{bessel.pdf}
    \caption{Geometry of a Bessel beam, generated by an axicon lens. $\beta$ is the angle with the optical axis, and the angle of the conical waves. $\alpha$ is the axicon angle.}
    \label{fig:besselgeo}
\end{figure}

From the scalar description of the electric component of the beam, we get:

\begin{equation}
    E(r,z)=E_0\sqrt{\frac{2\pi k z w_0sin(\beta)}{z_{max}}}\ \text{exp}^{\left(-\frac{z^2}{z_{max}^2}-\frac{i\pi}{4}\right)}\ J_0\left(krsin(\beta)\right)\ \text{exp}^{\left(ikzcos(\beta)\right)}
    \label{eqn:besselEfield}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where:

    \indent k is the wavevector, $k=\tfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ [$m$];

    \indent z is the distance from the axicon tip [$m$]; 

    \indent $\beta$ is the angle the wavefront propagates at (see~\cref{fig:besselgeo}) [$rad$]; 

    \indent $w_0$ is the $\tfrac{1}{e^2}$ width of the input Gaussian beam [$m$]; 

    \indent $J_0$ is the Bessel function of the first order; 

    \indent r is radial distance from the optical axis [$m$]. 

\medskip


~\Cref{eqn:besselEfield} gives the electric field for a Bessel beam. The intensity can be calculated using:

\begin{equation}
    I(r,z)=\frac{c\epsilon_0\left|E_0\right|^2}{2}
    \label{eqn:besselintsub}
\end{equation}

Using the definition total power transmitted by a beam as:

\begin{equation}
    P=\frac{\pi I_0w_0^2}{2}
    \label{eqn:pwrdef}
\end{equation}

Where $I_0$ is defined as on axis intensity of the incident Gaussian beam.

\begin{equation}
    I_0=\frac{c\epsilon_0E_0^2}{2}
    \label{eqn:intdef}
\end{equation}

Substituting~\cref{eqn:besselEfield,eqn:intdef,eqn:pwrdef} into~\cref{eqn:besselintsub} yields:

\begin{equation}
    I(r,z)=\frac{4k_rP}{w_0}\frac{z}{z_{max}}J_0^2\left(k_r\ r\right)\text{exp}^{\left(-\frac{2z^2}{z^2_{max}}\right)}
    \label{eqn:besselInt}
\end{equation}


\noindent Where:

    \indent $k_r$ is the radial wavevector, $k_r=k sin(\beta)$;

    \indent P is the power of the incident Gaussian beam.

    \medskip

To check out method accurately models Bessel beams, we compare out beam to theoretical expressions and experimental data.

To compare against a theoretical Bessel beam, a Bessel beam is modelled in the MCRT phase simulation, and propagated through air past the ``Bessel region''. 
A slice of the intensity is then plotted against what the theory predicts the Bessel beam should look like. 
A check of how the Bessel beam propagates in the far field is also preformed.


~\Cref{eqn:besselInt} gives the profile of a theoretical Bessel beam at a depth $z_{max}$, this is plotted against the simulation when $\tfrac{4k_rPz}{w_0z_{max}}e^{-2\left(\tfrac{z}{z_{max}}\right)^2}=1$, with the simulation normalised to a maximum of 1 as well. ~\Cref{fig:besselCompare} shows this comparison.

    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption{Comparison of theoretical and MCRT simulation of a Bessel beams, with intensity normalised.}
    \label{fig:besselCompare}
\end{figure}

To ensure our algorithm works in turbid media, we carried out an experiment where a Bessel beam was propagated through a medium of varying turbidity.
A laser, wavelength $488~nm$, with a Gaussian profile is shone on an axicon lens, with angle $5~^{\circ}$.
The laser beam had a $\tfrac{1}{e^2}$ spot size of $2~mm$. 
The Bessel beam was allowed to propagate through the air for $10~cm$ before entering a cuvette of side $2~mm$.
The cuvette was filled with $500~\mu L$ of water, and various volumes of a scattering agent added.
The scattering agent used is intralipid $20~\%$, which is diluted as shown in~\cref{tab:intra}.
Images of the Bessel as it emerges from the cuvette are taken for comparison with out algorithm.
~\Cref{fig:expsetup} shows the experimental setup.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{bessel-exp-setup.pdf}
    \caption{Experimental setup for propagating a Bessel beam through a cuvette filled with varying concentrations of Intralipid 20\%. Bessel beam is imaged by an 20x objective lens and a Grasshopper 3 camera.}

\end{figure}

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Intralipid solutions used for experiment.}
    \label{tab:intra}
\end{table}


To model the experimental setup we simplify the setup considerably.
The simulation setup models just the phase delay of the axicon on the laser beam and the beams propagation through the cuvette onto an image plane.

\section{Gaussian Beams}

implementation of lenss -> plano-convex and aspheric
emphasis no coding of focal distance
spherical aberrations 
curvature of phase change

need to find factor root 2

\section{Other Beams}

Our technique outlined in the preceding sections, can also be applied to arbitrary non-diffracting or complex beams. The only requirements for our algorithm to be able to model a complex beam, is that there is some phase delay that can be modelled analytically\footnote{It may be possible to model phase delays that are not analytical expressions. Simulating spatial light modulators may also be possible with our algorithm.}.

The first example of using our algorithm to model complex beams is to model a Laguerre-Gauss beam. A Laguerre-Gauss beam can be created by introducing a helical phase delay to a plane wave blah blah. ***put theory here + phase and interference patterns for all beams

Another example of our algorithms flexibility is that it can also model Hermite-Gauss beams, higher order Bessel beams and airy beams
