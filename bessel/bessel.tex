\section{Introduction}\label{sec:besintro}

%Intro = mention complex beams and their uses then move onto gaussian and bessel beams



Bessel beams have been the subject of intense research since their discovery in 1987~\cite{durnin1987diffraction,durnin1987exact}. Durnin noticed that the blah blah.
%Bessel beams have since been used for blah blah
%They are really good and like are better than Gaussian beams allegedly.

This chapter examines how Bessel beams compare to other beam in a scattering medium. 
We investigate if the Bessel beams self-healing property has any effect in a turbid medium.
We examine Bessel beams and the other beams by creating a novel~\gls*{mcrt} algorithm that allows the tracking of a photon as it propagates through a medium. 
The main focus of this chapter, is validation of our new novel technique, followed by using the new algorithm ($\varphi MC$) to compare Gaussian and Bessel beams, to see which one preforms better in a turbid medium. 
This chapter also extends out novel algorithm to other complex, diffraction less beams


%motivation = better imaging of chick embryos etc


\section{Theory}\label{sec:bestheory}

The \gls*{mcrt} algorithm as described in~\cref{sec:mcrt}, must be adjusted so that wave phenomena such as interference and diffraction can be modelled. 
Modelling these wave behaviours allows us to model complex beams, where these phenomena are required to form the beam, e.g Bessel beams. 
As \gls*{mcrt} is a ballistic simulation of photon packets, meaning that the \gls*{mcrt} simulation presented thus far in this thesis only modelled the ballistic behaviour of photons. 
However for the work presented in this chapter, wave like behaviour is crucial to modelling the various experiments and phenomena.

To convert a ballistic simulation of photon packets into a ballistic/wave-like simulation, the complex phase of each photon packet is tracked.
This is achieved, by simply tracking the complex phase of the photon as it propagates through a medium.
~\Cref{eqn:phase} shows how the phase is calculated.

\begin{equation}
    \varphi = cos\left(\frac{2 \pi l}{\lambda}\right) + i\ sin\left(\frac{2 \pi l}{\lambda}\right)
    \label{eqn:phase}
\end{equation}

Where $\varphi~[-]$ is the phase of a photon packet, $l\ [m]$ is the distance the photons has travelled, $\lambda~[m]$ is the wavelength of the photon, and \textit{i} is the solution to $x^2=-1$.
Now we can calculate the phase of a photon at a position $P_o$, if we know the distance it has travelled, and its original phase,~\cref{fig:phase-diag}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{phase-diag.pdf}
    \caption{Example of phase calculation when a photon has travelled a distance l. Figure also show an example of interference between two photons via addition of the complex amplitudes at the point $P_0$.}
    \label{fig:phase-diag}
\end{figure}

To be able model the wave-like behaviour of photons, we let the photons packets interfere with one another in a volume or area element. 
We do not model the interference at a point in space where photons packets cross one another as due to the ballistic nature of the \gls*{mcrt} simulation, this does not occur with enough frequency in order to give a good signal to noise ratio. 
Thus, interference takes place in a volume, $dV$, or area element, $dA$, instead.
To calculate the interference from the phase, the phase is summed in each volume or area element and the absolute value taken, and then squared.~\Cref{eqn:intense} shows the equation for interference for a volume element $dV$. A similar relation for calculating the interference on an area element $dA$ also exists.

\begin{equation}
I(\xi)=\left| \sum\limits_{\xi}cos\left(\frac{2\pi l}{\lambda}\right) + i \sum\limits_{\xi}sin\left(\frac{2\pi l}{\lambda}\right)\right|^2,\ \ \ \xi=(x,y,z)
\label{eqn:intense}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where:

\indent $l$ is the total distance travelled by a photon [$m$];

\indent $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon [$m$];

\indent $I$ is the intensity at the $\xi^{th}$ cell [$W m^{-2}$];

\indent and $\xi$ is the $x^{th}$, $y^{th}$, $z^{th}$ cell, volume $dV$.

\medskip

As the \gls*{mcrt} simulation is now a quasi ballistic/wave simulation of photon behaviour, comparisons between the simulations and, theoretical and experimental data to prove this model is accurate. However before validation of the model takes place, one further principle needs to be introduced that is required for our model to work.

\subsection{Huygens-Fresnel Principle}

The Huygens-Fresnel principle is a method that is used to help model the propagation of waves in the far field limit and the near field limit. 

The Huygens principle states~\cite{huygens2012treatise,hecht2017optics,huygens1900wave}: 

\medskip

``Every point on a propagating wavefront serves as the source of spherical secondary wavelets, such as the source at some time later is the envelope of these wavelets.''

\medskip

The principle is illustrated in~\cref{fig:huygensillis}. Christiaan Huygens postulated this principle in 1678.
The principle allowed Huygens to derive laws of refraction and reflection, but it failed to describe diffraction effects.
This led to Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1818, combining the Huygens principle with his own theory of interference~\cite{fresnel1819memoire,huygens1900wave}.
This principle, the Huygens-Fresnel principle, gave an accurate description of the propagation of light and diffraction effects.
This was achieved by allowing the secondary wavelets to self interfere with one another, giving rise to an accurate description of the physical phenomena.
Later, Gustav Kirchhoff gave a rigours mathematical description of the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which is the basis of diffraction theory~\cite{kirchhoff1883ann,born2000principles}. 

The Huygens-Fresnel principle allows the modelling of diffraction in both the near and far field.
As the principle states that every point on the wavefront is a source of secondary spherical waves, this implies that there are ``backward'' waves.
These ``backward'' waves are unphysical, and there is no evidence of their existence.
Thus Fresnel introduced and inclination factor to eliminate these ``backward'' waves.
This inclination factor was later put on rigorous mathematical standing by Kirchoff, as it naturally fell out of his theory.~\cite{kirchhoff1883ann,born2000principles}

\medskip

Our algorithm uses the Huygens-Fresnel principle to simulate diffraction effects, that would otherwise be absent from the simulation.
The principle allows the algorithm to calculate the complex amplitude at a point, and thus the intensity at that point.
The Huygens-Fresnel principle is implemented by sampling the light source on the surface of any lens or in a slit.
In practise this means when for example, a plane wave is incident on a slit width \textit{a}, and length \textit{b}, the slit area is uniformly sampled for the initial position of the photon packets.
The packets are then given a random direction, sampled towards the detector thus avoiding the non-existent ``backward'' waves.
For the case of modelling propahation through a lens, the usual geometric optics approach is taken to propagate the packets through the lens.
When the packet lies on the surface of the lens, the Huygens-Fresnel principle is invoked, and the packet is given a random direction (in the direction of the medium) and propagated as usual.


This is the principle that underpins the algorithm that allows various complex beams, and wave phenomena to be simulated within a ballistic method. The following sections validate the method against the theory and experimental data for various complex beam propagation.

    \label{fig:huygensillis}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Validation of Phase Tracking Algorithm}

\subsubsection*{Double Slit Experiment}

The first test of our phase tracking algorithm, is to compare our simulation to a double slit experiment.
The double slit experiment, is a simple experiment where monochromatic plane wave of light is incidence on two slits distance apart $a$, and width $b$, and the interference pattern is observed on a screen a distance $d$ away from the slits.

This experiment, first carried out by Thomas Young and thus sometimes called Young's slits experiment, is usually carried out with the detector screen in the far field. The so called Fraunhofer regime.
The intensity pattern on the detector screen is as in\cref{eqn:doubleslit}:

\begin{equation}
    I(\theta) \propto cos^2\left(\frac{\pi d\ sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)sinc^2\left(\frac{\pi b\ sin\theta}{\lambda}\right)
    \label{eqn:doubleslit}
\end{equation}

Where the $sinc$ function is defined as $\tfrac{sin(x)}{x}$, for $x\ \neq 0$, d is the slit separation and $\theta$ is the angular spacing of the fringes.

The simulation was carried out for a wavelength of , a slit width of, and a slit separation of .
Using the Huygens-Fresnel principle, each slit is a source of Huygens wavelets.
The initial position of the photon packets is sampled uniformly from the slit area, after randomly choosing one of the slits.
A random direction is then chosen to ensure that the packets will hit the detector screen.
The simulation was run with photon packets, which took to run on an 8 core Intel Xeon machine.
This gave an accurate match to the theoretical expression, as seen in~\cref{fig:doubleslitcomp}.


\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[]{}
    \caption{Comparison of theory and simulation for the double slit experiment. $\lambda$ is $x nm$, $b$ is, and $d$}
    \label{fig:doubleslitcomp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Diffraction by a Square Slit}
$\varphi MC$ is also validated by simulating diffraction from a square aperture in the far and near field, the so call Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes. 
Fresnel diffraction occurs in the near field when the \textit{Fresnel number},~\cref{eqn:fnumber}, is greater than 1.0.
Fraunhofer diffraction occurs when the \textit{Fresnel number} is less than 1.0.

\begin{equation}
F = l\sqrt{\frac{2}{\lambda r_0}}
\label{eqn:fnumber}
\end{equation}

\Cref{eqn:fnumber} is the Fresnel number, a measure of whether diffraction is in the Fresnel regime or the Fraunhofer regime.
\textit{l} is the slit width, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident radiation, and $r_0$ is the distance from the aperture to the detector screen, as shown in~\cref{fig:aperture}. 

\medskip
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{aperture.pdf}
    \caption{Fresnel diffraction at a square aperture.}
    \label{fig:aperture}
\end{figure}

In order to compare $\varphi MC$ to the theory, the theory must first be examined.
Consider the setup as shown in~\cref{fig:aperture}, in order to calculate the intensity at a point $P$, the contribution by an area element $dS$ at the point a, to the optical disturbance at a point \textit{P} is considered.
Accounting for the the unobstructed optical disturbance from $S$ as well, yields: 


\begin{equation}
U(P)=\frac{1}{i\lambda}\iint\limits_{\Sigma} \frac{Ae^{i(k\rho-\omega t)}}{\rho} \frac{e^{ikr}}{r}cos(\theta)\ dS
\label{eqn:disturb}
\end{equation}


In the case where $\rho_0$ and $r_0$ are large compared to the size of the aperture, then $cos(\theta) = 1$ and $\tfrac{1}{\rho r}=\tfrac{1}{\rho_0 r_0}$.
The lengths of $r_0$ and $\rho_0$ are:

\begin{align}
r=&\sqrt{r_0^2+y^2+z^2}\label{eqn:r} \\
\rho=&\sqrt{\rho_0^2+y^2+z^2}\label{eqn:rho}
\end{align}

Using the binomial theorem to expand~\cref{eqn:r,eqn:rho} yields:

\begin{equation}
\rho + r \approx \rho_0 + r_0 + (y^2+z^2)\frac{\rho_0r_0}{2\rho_0r_0}
\label{eqn:binomial}
\end{equation}

Substituting~\cref{eqn:binomial} into~\cref{eqn:disturb} with $k=2\pi/\lambda$

\begin{equation}
U(P)=\frac{Ae^{-i[k(\rho_0+r_0)\omega t]}}{i\lambda\rho_0r_0}\iint\limits_{\Sigma} e^{i2\pi y^2\tfrac{(\rho_0+r_0)}{2\lambda\rho_0r_0}+i2\pi z^2e^{\frac{i\pi u^2}{2}}\tfrac{(\rho_0+r_0)}{2\lambda\rho_0r_0}} \ dS
\label{eqn:midway}
\end{equation}


Introducing the dimensionless variables \textit{u} and \textit{v}

\begin{align}
u&=y\sqrt{\frac{2(\rho_0+r_0)}{\lambda\rho_0r_0}}\\
v&=z\sqrt{\frac{2(\rho_0+r_0)}{\lambda\rho_0r_0}}
\end{align}

and substituting them into~\cref{eqn:midway}.

\begin{equation}
U(P)=\frac{\tilde{E}_u}{2}\int_{u_1}^{u_2} e^{\tfrac{i\pi u^2}{2}}\ du\int_{v_1}^{v_2} e^{\tfrac{i\pi v^2}{2}} \ dv
\label{eqn:pentdisturb}
\end{equation}
\Cref{eqn:pentdisturb} describes the optical disturbance at the point $P$, with $\tilde{E}_u$ the unobstructed disturbance at $P$.
\Cref{eqn:pentdisturb} can be evaluated using the Fresnel integrals, $C(w)$ and $S(w)$:


\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{w}e^{i\pi w'^2/2}dw'=C(w)+iS(w)
\label{eqn:fresneleqn}
\end{equation}


\begin{align}
S(w)&=\int^w_0 sin\left(\frac{\pi w'^2}{2}\right)dw'\label{eqn:fresint1}\\
C(w)&=\int^w_0 cos\left(\frac{\pi w'^2}{2}\right)dw'\label{eqn:fresint2}
\end{align}


Using~\cref{eqn:fresneleqn}, where $C(w)$ and $S(w)$ are the Fresnel integrals as in~\cref{eqn:fresint1,eqn:fresint2},~\cref{eqn:pentdisturb} can then be transformed into an intensity, by taking the absolute value and squaring, yielding~\cref{eqn:fresIntensityp}:


\begin{equation}
I_p = \frac{I_u}{4} \{[C(u_2) - C(u1)]^2 + [S(u_2) - S(u_1)]^2\} \times \{[C(v_2) - C(v_1)]^2 + [S(v_2) - S(v_1)]^2\}
\label{eqn:fresIntensityp}
\end{equation}

\Cref{eqn:fresIntensityp} gives the intensity of the field at the point $P$ on axis for a square aperture where $I_u$ is the unobstructed intensity at the point $P$. 

\medskip

As the mathematics of calculating the optical disturbances at all points on a plane at point $P$ is difficult, instead the aperture is moved by small displacements, with $\overrightarrow{SOP}$ fixed.
This effectively achieves the translation of the origin, $O$, with respect to the fixed aperture. 
Thus, for each displacement new aperture coordinates $y_1, y_2, z_1, \text{and } z_2$ are generated and therefore new $u_1, u_2, v_1, \text{and }v_2$.
Therefore the intensity at a point $P +\delta d$, where $\delta d$ is the displacement, can be calculated.
This approximation holds for displacements that are small compared to the $\rho_0$~\cite{born2000principles,hecht2017optics,goodman2017introduction}.
Using this method and~\cref{eqn:fresIntensityp} gives the theoretical curves curves in~\cref{fig:frescompare}.

\medskip

In $\varphi MC$, the above experiment is simulated. 
A square slit is uniformly sampled in the $y$, and $z$ direction in order to get the packets initial position. 
A random direction is then sampled, ensuring that the direction points towards the detector screen.

The detector screen's distance from the aperture is then varied and the intensity on the screen is measured for $\sim 10^{10}$ photons released from the aperture, as Huygens wavelets.
For \textit{Fresnel numbers} greater than 1.0, the number of bins is 300, covering a distance of 600~$\mu m$. 
For the case of Fraunhofer diffraction, the number of bins is 100 covering a distance of 6000~$\mu m$.
The simulations take $\sim$ 3 minutes for $10^{10}$ packets to be run on an Intel Xeon E3--1245 v5, 8 cores @ 3.5GHz machine.
The number of bins, and photons packets simulated had to be increased for the cases where the Fresnel number was large (i.e the detector screen was near the aperture)
\cref{fig:frescompare} shows the comparison between the theory and the $\varphi MC$ simulations.

\section{Bessel Beams}

Bessel beams, as described in the introduction to this chapter, are ``non--diffracting'' beams, that can ``self heal''.
This means, in reality, that the central core of the beam does not spread out, and that if a blockage is placed in front of the beam, the beam reforms further down the optical axis.
There is some debate amongst physicists as to weather these phenomena are justly labelled, or if they glib terms used to make Bessel beams seem like the solution to everything.

The first ``complex'' beam simulated using $\varphi MC$ is a Bessel beam. 
Bessel beams are non-diffractive solutions to the wave equation. 
Bessel beams were first shown to blah

    \caption{Geometry of a Bessel beam, generated by an axicon lens. $\beta$ is the angle with the optical axis, and the angle of the conical waves. $\alpha$ is the axicon angle.}
    \label{fig:besselgeo}
\end{figure}

From the scalar description of the electric component of the beam, we get:

\begin{equation}
    E(r,z)=E_0\sqrt{\frac{2\pi k z w_0sin(\beta)}{z_{max}}}\ \text{exp}^{\left(-\frac{z^2}{z_{max}^2}-\frac{i\pi}{4}\right)}\ J_0\left(krsin(\beta)\right)\ \text{exp}^{\left(ikzcos(\beta)\right)}
    \label{eqn:besselEfield}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where:

    \indent k is the wavevector, $k=\tfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ [$m$];

    \indent z is the distance from the axicon tip [$m$]; 

    \indent $\beta$ is the angle the wavefront propagates at (see~\cref{fig:besselgeo}) [$rad$]; 

    \indent $w_0$ is the $\tfrac{1}{e^2}$ width of the input Gaussian beam [$m$]; 

    \indent $J_0$ is the Bessel function of the first order; 

    \indent r is radial distance from the optical axis [$m$]. 

\medskip


~\Cref{eqn:besselEfield} gives the electric field for a Bessel beam. The intensity can be calculated using:

\begin{equation}
    I(r,z)=\frac{c\epsilon_0\left|E_0\right|^2}{2}
    \label{eqn:besselintsub}
\end{equation}

Using the definition total power transmitted by a beam as:

\begin{equation}
    P=\frac{\pi I_0w_0^2}{2}
    \label{eqn:pwrdef}
\end{equation}

Where $I_0$ is defined as on axis intensity of the incident Gaussian beam.

\begin{equation}
    I_0=\frac{c\epsilon_0E_0^2}{2}
    \label{eqn:intdef}
\end{equation}

Substituting~\cref{eqn:besselEfield,eqn:intdef,eqn:pwrdef} into~\cref{eqn:besselintsub} yields:

\begin{equation}
    I(r,z)=\frac{4k_rP}{w_0}\frac{z}{z_{max}}J_0^2\left(k_r\ r\right)\text{exp}^{\left(-\frac{2z^2}{z^2_{max}}\right)}
    \label{eqn:besselInt}
\end{equation}


\noindent Where:

    \indent $k_r$ is the radial wavevector, $k_r=k sin(\beta)$;

    \indent P is the power of the incident Gaussian beam.

    \medskip

To check out method accurately models Bessel beams, we compare out beam to theoretical expressions and experimental data.

To compare against a theoretical Bessel beam, a Bessel beam is modelled in the MCRT phase simulation, and propagated through air past the ``Bessel region''. 
A slice of the intensity is then plotted against what the theory predicts the Bessel beam should look like. 
A check of how the Bessel beam propagates in the far field is also preformed.


~\Cref{eqn:besselInt} gives the profile of a theoretical Bessel beam at a depth $z_{max}$, this is plotted against the simulation when $\tfrac{4k_rPz}{w_0z_{max}}e^{-2\left(\tfrac{z}{z_{max}}\right)^2}=1$, with the simulation similarly normalised, by normalising to the maximum intensity of the image generated. ~\Cref{fig:besselCompare} shows this comparison.

    \caption{Comparison of theoretical and MCRT simulation of a Bessel beams, with intensity normalised. The results from $\varphi MC$ show good agreement with the theory.}
    \label{fig:besselCompare}
\end{figure}

To ensure our algorithm works in turbid media, we carried out an experiment where a Bessel beam was propagated through a medium of varying turbidity.
A laser, wavelength $488~nm$, with a Gaussian profile is shone on an axicon lens, with angle $5~^{\circ}$.
The laser beam had a $\tfrac{1}{e^2}$ spot size of $2~mm$. 
The Bessel beam was allowed to propagate through the air for $10~cm$ before entering a cuvette of side $2~mm$.
The cuvette was filled with $500~\mu L$ of water, and various volumes of a scattering agent added.
The scattering agent used is intralipid $20~\%$ (Sigma-Aldrich), which is diluted as shown in~\cref{tab:intra}.
Dilutions of Intralipid are kept below 2\% scattering particle concentration, so that the scattering exhibited by the intralipid is in the independent scattering regime.
This allows the linear scaling of the optical properties by concentrations~\cite{aernouts2013supercontinuum,vardaki2015studying,di2011effect}.
Images of the Bessel beam as it emerges from the cuvette are taken for comparison with out algorithm.
~\Cref{fig:expsetup} shows the experimental setup.

    \caption{Intralipid solutions used for experiment.}
    \label{tab:intra}
\end{table}


To model within $\varphi MC$, the experimental setup we simplify the setup considerably.
The simulation models the propagation of a photon packet through the axicon to its conical surface. 
On the conical surface the Huygens-Fresnel principle is invoked, and the packet is sampled onto the surface of the medium (cuvette).
The sampling of the photon onto the surface of the medium, speeds the algorithm up, as it does not need to simulate the photons that would ``miss'' the medium.
From there the usual~\gls*{mcrt} method propagates the packet through the medium while tracking its phase, and scattering the packet until it leaves the medium.
If the packet leaves the medium to any side other than the far side of the cuvette (e.g any side of the cuvette not facing the objective lens), then it is discarded.
If the packet leaves the medium on the objective lens facing side, then the packet is recorded by its phase onto an area element.
For each intralipid concentration $3.2\times10^{11}$ photons are run over 32 cores, taking $\sim 4$ hours for the 0.5448\% intralipid concentration.
Once all the photon packets have been run, the image is the phase is converted into intensity, as in~\cref{eqn:intense}, but in 2D.

\Cref{fig:compareexpbessel} shows the results from the experiment and simulation. The simulation shows good agreement with experimental data.

\section{Other Beams}

Our technique outlined in the preceding sections, can also be applied to arbitrary non-diffracting or complex beams. The only requirements for our algorithm to be able to model a complex beam, is that there is some phase delay that can be modelled analytically\footnote{It may be possible to model phase delays that are not analytical expressions. Simulating spatial light modulators may also be possible with our algorithm.}.

The first example of using our algorithm to model complex beams is to model a Laguerre-Gauss beam. A Laguerre-Gauss beam can be created by introducing a helical phase delay to a plane wave blah blah. ***put theory here + phase and interference patterns for all beams

Another example of our algorithms flexibility is that it can also model Hermite-Gauss beams, higher order Bessel beams and airy beams
