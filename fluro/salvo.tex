\section{Skin Model}

So far in this thesis all tissue models have been simplified, by assuming that tissue is a homogeneous structure with uniform optical properties.
However this is not the case in reality.
Tissue is very un-homogeneous, with non-uniform optical properties.
However to create a 1 to 1 model of tissue in a simulation is impractical due to the resolution required to resolve all the constituent part of the tissue down to the cell level.
Therefore we need to make a compromise between reality and what is possible to model efficiently.
To this end the section presents a 5 layer model of human skin. 
Dermatologists usually split the skin into 5 layers: Stratum Corneum, Epidermis\footnote{The epidermis can be split into several more layers, however these layers are optical similar and are rather small so we model just one layer here.}, Papillary Dermis, Reticular Dermis, and Hypodermis, see~\cref{fig:skinexample}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Skin_layers.pdf}
    \caption{Illustration of skin layers in human skin.}
    \label{fig:skinexample}
\end{figure}

Each of these layers have various amounts of chromophores and scatterers.
To accurately model these various chromophores and scatterers, and therefore the skin, we must discuss the chemical makeup and spatial structure of the skin.

\subsection*{Stratum Corenum} % (fold)
\label{sub:stratum}

The top most layer of the skin is the stratum corenum.
This layer mostly consists of dead skin cells (keratinocytes).
The function of this layer is to be a protection barrier to prevent damage, infection and diffusion of unwanted chemicals.

% subsection stratum_corenum (end)

\subsubsection*{Epidermis} % (fold)
\label{ssub:epidermis}

Below the stratum corenum is the epidermis.
The epidermis consist of several layers that are optically similar so we restrict out model to modelling as one whole layer.
The layers that make up the epidermis are the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and the stratum lucidum\footnote{The stratum corenum is usually part of the epidermis, however as its optical properties are different than that of the epidermis we model it as a separate layer.}.
The purpose of the epidermis is as before to provide a protective barrier to the underlying layers. 
The epidermis contains melanin which protects the stem cell keratinocyte which divide to form keratinocyte which form much of the upper layers of the skin.
In the stratum basale there is also melanocyte which produce the pigment melanin which is responsible for the color of the skin, and providing some protection from harmful UV light. 
Other types of cells found i the epidermis are Langerhans cells and Merkel cells which are part of the immune system and nervous system respectively.

The dermis is split into three different layers in our model: the papillary dermis, reticular dermis and the hypodermis.

The papillary dermis has blood

The reticular dermis has blood

The hypodermis consists of fat and

With a discussion of what makes up the skin, and what molecules contribute to the skins optical properties, this section gives an account of how our skin model, models the optical properties of skin.

To model blood, we first split blood into deoxygenated and oxygenated. We mix these two groups using the tissue oxygenation coefficient $S$. Blood absorption spectra are taken from%~\cite{}

\begin{equation}
\mu_{a,oxy/deoxy}=150\ \ln10\ \frac{\epsilon}{64458}
\label{eqn:oxy}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mu_{a,b}(\lambda) = SO_2\mu_{a,Oxy}+(1-SO_2)\mu_{a,DeOxy}
\label{eqn:blood}
\end{equation}

The next chromophores are bilirubin and $\beta$-carotene.
The absorption coefficients are calculated using the blah 

\begin{equation}
\mu_{a,Bilirubin}(\lambda)=\frac{\epsilon_{bilirubin}}{585}\ ln10\ C_{bilirubin}
\label{eqn:bili}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mu_{a,\beta-Caro}(\lambda)=\frac{\epsilon_{\beta-Caro}}{537}\ ln10\ C_{\beta-Caro}
\label{eqn:caro}
\end{equation}

To model melanin's absorption coefficient we use~\cref{eqn:eqn:melanin}, taken from...

\begin{equation}
\mu_{a,mel}(\lambda)=6.66\times10^{11} \times \lambda^{-3.33}
\label{eqn:eqn:melanin}
\end{equation}

Finally we use a base absorption coefficient to model the absorption due to the other parts of the skin that contribute to its optical properties, but individually do not have a large effect.

\begin{equation}
\mu_{a,b}=7.84\times10^{8}\times\lambda^{-3.255}
\label{eqn:base}
\end{equation}

  \caption{Absorption coefficients for the different layers in the skin.}
  \label{fig:absoplayers}
\end{figure}


AS the scattering properties do not vary from layer to layer by too much we use the same equation to describe the scattering coefficient. ***ref jacques, louise thesis and iglesias***

\begin{equation}
\mu'_s(\lambda)=a'\left(f_{ray}\left(\frac{\lambda}{500(nm)}\right)^4+(1-f_{ray})\left(\frac{\lambda}{500(nm)}\right)^{-b_{\text{mie}}}\right)
\label{eqn:scattrest}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mu'_s(\lambda)=1050.60\times\lambda^{-0.68}
\label{eqn:hyposcat}
\end{equation}


\noindent Where:

	$\mu'_s$ is the reduced scattering coefficient [$cm^-1$];

	$a'$ is a scaling factor [$cm^-1$];

	$f_{ray}$ is the fraction of Raylieigh scattering [-];

	$\lambda$ is the wavelength of light [$m$];

	and $b_{\text{mie}}$ is the ``scattering power'' [-].

\subsubsection*{Fluorophores in the Skin}


NADH, trytophan, tyrosine, collagen, FAD, elastin

	\caption{Top) Shows the fluorescent emission for the various different fluorophores. Bottom) Extinction coefficients for a selection fluorophores found in the skin.}
	\label{fig:flurosshow}
\end{figure}

\section{Modelling Fluorescence}

Fluroescene is the process in which light of a certain wavelength is incident on a molecule, the molecule absorbs the light and re-emits the light at a new longer wavelength.

\Cref{fig:Jabo} shows an example of Jablonski diagram.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{jabo-diag.pdf}
	\caption{Jablonski diagram for PPIX. a) excitation of the ground state via absorption of a photon, b) non-radiative transition, and c) fluorescence.}
	\label{fig:Jabo}
\end{figure}

To model fluorescence from multiple fluorophores requires a change of the \gls*{mcrt} code presented thus far.
This change is to the interaction portion of the algorithm, so that it will now include the option for a packet to undergo fluorescence.
To calculate whether a packet absorbs, scatters or fluoresces, first the probability of each of these events must be calculated.
Discussion of scattering and absorption (by the bulk medium) was described in~\cref{sec:opticalprops}.
To calculate the probability of fluorescence, we first assume that the quantum yield of the molecule is unity.
This is physically unrealistic, however it does not affect the simulations accuracy, as modelling a realistic quantum yield would mean that more packets would be discarded, and thus the signal to noise ration would be worse than if we assume a quantum yield of unity.
To calculate the probability of fluorescence, the absorption coefficient of the florescent molecule must be calculated.
This is shown in~\cref{eqn:flurodef}:

\begin{equation}
\mu_f=\ln\left(10\right) C \varepsilon
\label{eqn:flurodef}
\end{equation}

Where $C$ is the concentration of the fluorophore, $\varepsilon$ is the extinction coefficient of the fluorophore, and $ln(10)$ is the natural logarithm of 10\footnote{This factor appears as historically $\varepsilon$ was measured in base 10~\cite{jacques2013optical}.}.\\

The next step is to calculate the total attenuation coefficient for a given species as in~\cref{eqn:totdef}

\begin{equation}
\mu_{t_i}=\mu_{s_i}+\mu_{a_i}+\mu_{f_i}
\label{eqn:totdef}
\end{equation}

Where as usual $\mu_a$ and $\mu_s$ are the absorption and scattering coefficients, and $\mu_f$ is the fluorescence coefficient as defined in~\cref{eqn:flurodef}.
As the absorption coefficient of fluorophores are small in comparison to the medium, and that the absorption coefficient of fluorescent molecules are generally much larger than that of their scattering coefficient, we assume that the scattering coefficient is negligible.
Finally we calculate the probability of interacting with a given species using~\cref{eqn:totspec}

\begin{equation}
P_i=\frac{\mu_{t,i}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \mu_{t,i}}
\label{eqn:totspec}
\end{equation}

Where $P_i$ is the probability of interacting with the $i^{th}$ species, the numerator is the attenuation coefficient for $i^{th}$ species, and the denominator is the total attenuation coefficient for all the species.

\cref{algo:speciespick} shows the process used to determine which species to interact with.

\label{algo:speciespick}
\end{algorithm}
\end{center}

This method allows an arbitrary number of fluorophores to be modelled.
To ensure that this method works as intended, the method is compared to experimental data taken by Campbell \textit{et al.}.

$405~nm$ light was shone on a cuvette of area $10~mm \times 10~mm$.
The cuvette was filled with Intrlipid $20\%$ diluted with water, and a fluorescent agent Cop III.
The total volume of this mixture was $6~ml$, consisting of $1~ml$ of Cop III, $4.99~ml$ of water, and $0.0~1ml$ of Intrlipid $20\%$, of which $2~ml$ was pipetted into the cuvette.
$405~nm$ light was shone on the cuvette, and collected via the same fiber, of diameter $600~\mu m$.
The fiber has a NA of 0.22.
The signal is the recorded by a blah blah blah..

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{copor3.pdf}
	\caption{Optical properties of coporIII}
	\label{fig:coporiii}
\end{figure}

The simulation is setup to mimic the experimental setup.
A medium of $10~mm^3$ is used with 1 voxel to increase the speed of computation.
As before Intralipid is assumed to be wholly scattering with no absorption, so an albedo of 1 is used.
Conversely the CoporIII is wholly absorbing with no scattering.
CoporIII absorption coefficient is as shown along side its emission spectrum in~\cref{fig:coporiii}.
If a photon packets leave the top face of the simulated medium, within the radius of the fiber at an angle the fiber could accept, then the packet is recorded.
The simulation is run with $10^7$ photons which yielded~\cref{fig:flurovalid}.

\section{Nelder-Mead Method}

The \gls*{nm} method is an algorithm for unconstrained optimisation. 
The algorithm is based upon iteratively updating a simplex. 
A simplex is a structure in $n-dimensional$ space, consisting of $n+1$ points that are not in the same plane. 
Therefore in 1D, the simplex is a line, in 2D a triangle, in 3D a tetrahedron, etc.. 
The Nelder-Mead method is a gradient free method, meaning that it does not require derivatives to be calculated and that the search space does not need to be smooth.
This makes it ideal for problems where derivates are not able to be computed easily, or the search space is not smooth.
However the NM method can also get stuck at local minima so care must be taken to avoid this.

The NM algorithm works by removing the worst vertex of the simplex and replacing it with a `better' vertex calculated via a number of different operations.
These operations can be seen in~\cref{fig:NM-operations}.\\

The first step of the~\gls*{nm} method is to sort the initial vertices according to their fitness.
For $n=2$, we define $x_w$ as the `worst' point, $x_l$ and the `lousy' point, and $x_b$ the `best' point, such that $f(x_b)\leq f(x_l)\leq f(x_w)$, where $f(x)$ is evaluating the `fitness' of a point $x$. 
The fitness function varies from problem to problem, and usually takes the form of the function that is being optimised.

With the vertices sorted, the centroid of the simplex is calculated as in~\cref{eqn:centroid}.
The centroid is the mean of all the vertices bar the `worst' point.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{simplex-operations.pdf}
    \caption{Operations that can be preformed on a simplex for $n=2$.}
    \label{fig:NM-operations}
\end{figure}

The next step is to move the simplex via a reflection.
To calculate the new vertex via reflection~\cref{eqn:reflect} is used, where $\alpha$ is the reflection factor.
If this new point, $x_r$, is better\footnote{Here better means the point has a lower fitness score} than the current `best' point then we calculate a new point in the same direction but further using the expansion operation~\cref{eqn:expand}, where $\gamma$ is the expansion factor.
If this new point, $x_e$, is better than the `best' point then we replace $x_w$ with $x_e$ and start the process again.
However is $x_e$ is not better than the `best' point, then we discard it and replace the worst point with $x_r$ the reflected point.

If when calculating $x_r$, we find that is worse than the `best' point, we then check if $x_r$ is better than the `lousy' point.
If $x_r$ is better than $x_l$ then we replace the `worst' point and start the process again.
However if the $x_r$ is worse than $x_l$, we then compare it to the `worst' point.
If $x_r$ is better than the `worst' point then we preform and inside contraction~\cref{eqn:insidecontract}, where $\beta$ is the contraction factor.
If this new point, $x_{ic}$, is better than the `worst' point then we keep it, otherwise we preform the shrink operation, shrinking the whole simplex around the `best' point.

If $x_r$ is not worse than the `worst' point then we preform an outside contraction~\cref{eqn:outsidecontract}.
This computes a new point $x_{oc}$.
If $x_{oc}$ is better than $x_w$, then we keep it, otherwise again we shrink around the `best' point.

The process described above is summarised in~\cref{fig:NM-algo}.
Standard values for the factors are: $\alpha=1$, $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$, and $\gamma=2$.
Though in practice these values are adjusted for the problem at hand.

\begin{align}
c &= \frac{1}{n}\sum \limits_{i=1,i\neq w}^{n+1} x_i \label{eqn:centroid}\\
x_r &= c + \alpha(c - x_w)\label{eqn:reflect}\\
x_e &= c + \gamma(x_r - c)\label{eqn:expand}\\
x_{oc} &= c + \beta(x_r - c)\label{eqn:outsidecontract}\\
x_{ic} &= c + \beta(x_w - c)\label{eqn:insidecontract}
\end{align}

As the Nelder-Mead method has no inbuilt convergence criteria, this must be added.
We use two different criteria based upon simplex size, and vertex fitness.
The criteria for the simplex size is as; The size of the simplex is calculated using~\cref{eqn:sizeof}:

\begin{equation}
size=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n+1}|p_{i}-p_{i+1}|
\label{eqn:sizeof}
\end{equation}

Where $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are vertices in the simplex that are connected by an edge. 
If the size of the simplex falls below a pre-set value, then we preform a factorial test to see if the simplex should be restarted or if the algorithm should terminate.
The factorial test checks the space around the current simplex to ensure that we have converged to a global minima.
If the check fails then the algorithm is restarted with the current best point kept, and new vertices generated.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{flowchart.pdf}
    \caption{Nelder-Mead decision tree}
    \label{fig:NM-algo}
\end{figure}

The other convergence criteria is the a check to see if the best point is `good enough'.
The current best point is compared to a pre-set fitness value.
If the best point is better than the pre-set value then the algorithm terminates.

\section{Validation}
The~\gls*{nm} method was coded in Fortran, so that it could be easily interfaced with the~\gls*{mcrt} code developed as part of this thesis.
To test that the method works as intended a number of trial functions were tested, see~\cref{tab:testfuncs}.
This was achieved by selecting an initial simplex, and the method allowed to iterate until it converged.
The results of this are shown in~\cref{fig:nmtest}.

\end{figure}

Some of these functions (Sphere, and Rosenbrock's) can also be extended to arbitrary dimensions. These functions were used to check that the NM method works as intended in these higher dimensions where the NM method will primarily be used in this thesis.

To ensure that the~\gls*{nm} method can be used to find the unknown concentrations of the autoflurophores, we test the method with a known model.
This model consists of three different fluorophores: NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), and a fictitious fluorophore that has similar properties to NADH and tyrosine, such that the excitation spectrum is that of NADH and the emission spectrum is that of tyrosine.
The three fluorophores are distributed in the stratum corenum (NADH), epidermis (FAD), and the papillary dermis (fictitious).
The concentration in these layers is such that the bulk optical properties are not affected: NADH has a concentration of $1.05~\mu M$, FAD $0.525~m M$, and the fictitious fluorophore has a concentration of $0.125~mM$. % check units
The fitness function chosen to check whether the NM method is converging is as:

\begin{equation}
fitness = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-m_i)^2
\end{equation}

Where $x_i$ is a data point at a wavelength $\lambda_i$ produced by the MCRT, and $m_i$ is a data point in the model at a wavelength $\lambda_i$.

As many models need to be run in order to determine whether a global maxima has been reached using the NM method and that the fluorophore concentration is low, means that many packets need to be run to achieve a good single to noise ratio.
These two constraints result in a computational load that is infeasible to run. 
Therefore the ~\gls*{mcrt} algorithm has to be computationally efficient in order to arrive at an answer within a reasonable time.
To this end the 3D skin model is shrunk to a 1D model so that the optical integration routine can efficiently move the photon through the simulated medium.
The optical properties of the incident wavelength are also stored so that when a new photon is started the optical properties can easily be adjusted without need for any calculation.
Finally a filter is employed on the output fluorescence spectrum to smooth the noise out.
The filter used is a Savitzky–Golay filter.
This filter fits multiple low-degree polynomials to the subsets of the output, thus smoothing the data. 


\begin{figure}[!htbp]

	\caption{Example of toy model for testing NM method. The three peaks correspond to the fictitious fluorophore, NADH, and FAD respectively.}
	\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

The above model is first run through the MCRT to get an output target spectrum.
We then test the~\gls*{nm} method for $n=2$ and $n=3$.


\section{Results}

Before running the NM method on the experimental data, the fluence of the input and fluorescence light is analyses alongside the location as a function of depth of the fluorescent light.

\Cref{fig:uvpen} show the fluence as a function of depth for the indicent UV light.
The figure shows that most of the incident light is contained within the top three layers, with little getting to the Reticular dermis, with none reaching the Hypodermis.

\Cref{fig:fadnadhboth} shows the fluence of detected fluorescent light (see~\cref{app:lightdect} for discussion of how this is tracked.).
The figure shows that the fluence is highest in the Papillary dermis this is due to a number of reasons.
First the refractive indices of the layers are different, this can lead to light getting "trapped" in a layer as it maybe reflected of the layer boundary.
Secondly, fluorescent light is emitted isotropically which means that fluorescent light emitted in the upper layers of the skin, may be emitted in the direction of the Papillary dermis.
Finally the optical properties also have an effect on the detected light fluence.
***expand on this more once I have plotted the optical properties ***

\section{Discussion}

\section{Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}

We have presented out code, AmoebaMCRT, which combines the Nelder-Mead method and MCRT in order to determine the concentrations of naturally occurring fluorophores in human skin.


%AF Code works, tested against toy model, may need further validation. 

%No paper or aim for project. Need contact with Dundee/Ninewells to proceed.
