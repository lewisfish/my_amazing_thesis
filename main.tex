\chapter{Acknowledgements}
% \lipsum[1-2]
First of all, thank you to Tom, and Kenny for first allowing me the opportunity to undertake this PhD and for all their support and encouragement over the course of my thesis.
If it weren't for you both keeping me on the straight and narrow I'm sure I would still be coding instead of writing.
I also swear my code is now bug free...
\medskip

Thank you to Ian for getting me access to Wardlaw andKennedy computer clusters.
Most of this work wouldn't be possible without it.
\medskip

Thank you to Isla for answering all my stupid questions over the past three years, and for being a good source of moral support.
Thank you also for allowing me to be a part of code and cake, which I thoroughly enjoyed, both the baking and the talks.
\medskip

Thank you to all at Ninewells for making me feel welcome every time I took up space in your research office.
Especially thank you to Luke, Paul, and Ewan for letting me collaborate with you, and 
for your good company at the conferences we attended together.
\medskip

Thank you to my family for your support throughout my last nine years at St Andrews.
